    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>About 60 million years ago Southwestern North America was a mountain belt with the length of the Himilayas and the height of the Andes.  These mountains collapsed under their own load starting about 30 million years ago, ending in the classic Basin and Range providence that exists in the region today.  The geological history of this collapsing mountain belt is also connected with the formation of deposits of minerals critically necessary for the security and maintenance of the economic well being of the United States.</p>
