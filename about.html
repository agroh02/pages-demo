    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>About 60 million years ago Southwestern North America was a mountain belt with the length of the Himilayas and the height of the Andes.  These mountains collapsed under their own load starting about 30 million years ago, ending in the classic Basin and Range providence that exists in the region today.  The geological history of this collapsing mountain belt is also connected with the formation of deposits of minerals critically necessary for the security and maintenance of the economic well being of the United States.  The research team will test the hypothesis that fluids flowing through the crust were key to the collapse through the dating of fluorspar deposits that are geographically associated.  These deposits themselves are a critical mineral resource.  The research will use innovative dating methods to estimate the time of the formation of the fluorite and associated minerals and compare this with the time of collapse of the highlands.  The timing for the emplacement of these deposits will provide key information for proposed numerical simulations of the processes.  Previous geophysical studies have provided three dimensional imaging of the Earth's interior for the region that will also be used to inform and test the numerical simulations, and these geophysical studies will be updated to better aid the simulations.  The computer simulations will also contribute to a better understanding of the sources and magnitude of tectonic forces responsible for earthquakes in the region, contributing to a better seismic hazard assessment.  The project involves a collaborative plan to engage a diverse undergraduate and graduate student population with all components of laboratory, computational, and field work.</p>

    <p>Outstanding questions remain about the thermomechanical processes involved in the extensional collapse of the North American Southwest Cordillera, including the evolution of thermal input, crustal fluids and melts, topographic change, and plate tectonic and mantle flow evolution.</p>
